			<h2>About Marinduque</h2>
			<p>The island of Marinduque was originally home to the Tagalog people, who were part of the larger Austronesian-speaking population that inhabited the Philippines. In the 16th century, Spanish colonizers arrived on the island and established a settlement, which eventually grew into the town of Boac, the capital of Marinduque. During the Spanish colonial period, Marinduque became a center of the Catholic faith, with many churches and religious festivals celebrated throughout the year. Today, these traditions continue to be an important part of Marinduque's cultural identity, with the Moriones Festival, celebrated during Holy Week, being the most famous. Marinduque also played a significant role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule. The island was the site of the Battle of Pulang Lupa, where Filipino revolutionaries led by General Maximo Abad defeated a Spanish force in 1900. Today, Marinduque became a province of the newly independent Philippines and has since experienced significant economic growth and development.</p>
